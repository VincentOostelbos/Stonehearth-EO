GitHub repository for translation effort of Radiant Entertainment's Stonehearth from English (EN) into Esperanto (EO).

Please use diacritics, not cx, ch, etc.
Bonvolu uzi cxapelojn, ne cx, ch, ktp.

Thus far, I have left "hearthling" untranslated.

When done with the first pass, check for "TODO" and "..." to see if any translations are unfinished.
